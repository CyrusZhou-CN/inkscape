 * following the SPRepr mutations via callbacks.  During creation,
 * SPObject parses and interprets all textual attributes and CSS style
 * strings of the SPRepr, and later updates the internal state whenever
 * it receives a signal about a change. The opposite is not true - there
 * are methods manipulating SPObjects directly and such changes do not
 * propagate to the SPRepr layer. This is important for implementation of
 * the undo stack, animations and other features.
 *
 * SPObjects are bound to the higher-level container SPDocument, which
